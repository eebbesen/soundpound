This is my implementation of a project I created while taking [the Web Developer Bootcamp Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp).  This exercise is covered in chapter 19.

## Run locally
    npm start

## Serve on Heroku
Use the heroku/nodejs buildback to serve this project

1. Add heroku/nodejs as the buildpack in Heroku's Personal apps -> Settings page
1. Create a package.json file in the project root
1. Push to Heroku master
